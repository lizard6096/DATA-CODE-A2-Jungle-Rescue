## Project Overview
**Jungle Rescue Arcade Game** challenges players to navigate a jeep through a jungle landscape to rescue animals while avoiding obstacles. The player’s goal is to score as high as possible by rescuing animals and avoiding hazards. This project was developed using Microsoft MakeCode Arcade and Python, inspired by the simplicity and appeal of the Google Chrome dinosaur game.

## Features
- **Single-player Mode**: The player drives a safari jeep through the jungle on a side-scrolling screen.
- **Animal Rescue**: Colliding with animal sprites adds points to the score.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Colliding with an obstacle results in a game reset.
- **Score System**: Points increase by 10 for each rescued animal, with speed increments every 25 points.
- **Progressive Challenge**: The game speed increases as the score rises, making it more challenging.

## Gameplay
In Jungle Rescue, the player uses the arrow keys to move the jeep vertically to:
- **Rescue Animals**: Collide with animals to earn points.
- **Avoid Obstacles**: Stay clear of hazards to avoid resetting the game.

The player’s objective is to score the highest possible points in a single, continuous round.
